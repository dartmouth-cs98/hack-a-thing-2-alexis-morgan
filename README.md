# Hack-a-thing 2
Alexis Harris, Morgan Sorbaro

## What We Built
In this Hack-a-thing we built four different ios apps in Swift. Since we live together, we pair coded and alternated who was the driver for each game. 

*Ninja Game* - This game featured a ninja who shot at preditors as they approaced. If the preditors passed the ninja then the user would loose the game

*Cookie Crunch* - This is a cookie version of candy crush. The user swipes to remove the cookies. 

*Numbers Game* - In this game the user needs to add the number one to each digit in the presented number. The user has 60 seconds to do as many correctly as possible and gets a score at the end. 

## Who Did What
Alexis drove for Candy Crush and Food Tracker, while the Ninja Game and Number Game was coded on Morgan's Computer. 

## What We Learned
Overall this project taught us a lot about Swift and IOS developement. Swift is a lot different than react native which we have both worked with before and it was really interesting to see the similarities between Swift, React Native and Andriod Kotlin (which we learned in Mobile Development). Besides having a new base understanding of Xcode and Swift, each game taught us a lot of specific code features we would not otherwise have learned. 

*Ninja Game* - This game taught us a lot about randomly spawning objects and collision detection. We had to do projectile math to calculate where the ball should go reletive to the user's touch. From there, we needed to code collision objects to figure out if the ball had hit the attacker. 

*Cookie Crunch* - This game offered a lot of challenges and ended up not working well. That being said, we still learned how to read in files from Swift and how to parse them. The cookie crunch bored was set up from a JSON file so different levels could be created, and we learned how to use these level files and parse them in Swift. 

*Number Game* - The number game showed us how to work with Coco Pods. Cocopods are additions that you can add into your application and in this app we used them for the timer. 

## How Did This Inspire Us/Relate to Possible Ideas
There are so many ideas that can come from creating an IOS app. We think what was most inspiring was seeing how easy it is to create an app using the story board. In React Native you need to use CSS to style the whole app but with Swift the drag and drop program with constraints is much better and makes styling easier. We also were inspired by how many cocopod libraries there are to choose from and the different extensions you can easily get just by using a new library. 

If we want to make an app Swift would definitely be an interesting challenge to work with. 

## What Didn't Work
There are many things that did not work with our applications. First, the cookie crunch background images did not show up correctly and eventually we had to abandon the the tutorial due to many bugs being unsolvable. Moreover, getting the cocopods to work was much more complicated than expected. In the tutorial we were using it was just a few terminal commands and then it worked fine but on our computer there were many errors and we had to spend a lot of time on Stack Overflow to figure out why they weren't installing. At the end of the day it turns out the pod file wasn't correctly named and everything was fixed after that.
